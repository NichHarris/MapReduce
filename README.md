# MapReduce

Implemented MapReduce on Hadoop Standalone HDFS

Defined Map Reduce Algorithm
Set Up Runtime As Hadoop HDFS

- Partiton Data into Slices
- Aggregate Result of Data
- Transform Intermediate Results By Sorting or Shuffling
- Write Outputs

Num Maps = Num Lines = File Size / Partition Size
Num Reduces = Num Batches = Samples / Batch Size
